# ECE1513A3 
The purpose of this assignment is to investigate the classification performance of neural networks. You will implement, train and evaluate your neural network models using Pytorch on the notMNIST dataset. The functions are provided and you will need to fill-in after the TODO comment instead of coding them from scratch. In particular, in the first part, you will implement a fully connected neural networks (FNN). In the second part, you will implement a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a to-go architecture for image recognition task. In the final part, you will implement the model training loop. You will also be asked to answer several questions related to your implementations. You are encouraged to look up Pytorch documentation for useful utility functions, at: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html. You can also refer to the demo covered in the lecture. The notMNIST dataset is stored as notMNIST.npz inside in the assignment folder. We highly recommend students to look at the tutorial files for this assignment.
